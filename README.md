## What is NeoMutt?

* NeoMutt is a project of projects.
* A place to gather all the patches against Mutt.
* A place for all the developers to gather.

Hopefully this will build the community and reduce duplicated effort.

NeoMutt was created when Richard Russon (@FlatCap) took all the old Mutt patches,
sorted through them, fixed them up and documented them.

### Mutt

While NeoMutt is technically a fork of Mutt, the intention of the project is not to
diverge from Mutt, but rather to act as a common ground for developers to improve Mutt.

Collecting, sorting out and polishing patches to be incorporated upstream (into Mutt),
as well as being a place to gather and encourage further collaboration while reducing
redundant work, are among the main goals of NeoMutt. NeoMutt merges all changes from Mutt.

More information is available on the [About](https://neomutt.org/about.html) page on
the NeoMutt website.
